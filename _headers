  # When a browser requests /js/jquery-4.0.0-beta.js and supports Brotli (Accept-Encoding: br),
  # Netlify will look for /js/jquery-4.0.0-beta.js.br.
  # If found, and this Link header is present, Netlify serves the .br file and signals the browser
  # to use the specified dictionary.

# For the dictionary file itself
/js/jquery.dict
  # Specify the content type for the dictionary
  Content-Type: application/octet-stream # Some systems might use application/brotli-dictionary
  # Dictionaries are ideal for long caching

# with a specific content type, you can add rules for them too, though Netlify usually handles JS correctly.
